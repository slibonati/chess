with algebraic notation , we only have the target square not the current square

piece knows it's current square

piece can compute reachable squares

at times will need to understand if path is clear on rank or file 

for a given move can validate target versus reachable; if target is not in reachable, illegal move

need to consider boundaries of board when computing reachable 

piece needs reference to board ? for computing reachable; should piece do itself ? or game ?
