1. with algebraic notation, we only have the target square not the current square (need this cause square needs to be cleared)

	how to solve ? 
	
	Color/Player is needed
	
	it would seem you have to determine in reverse where the move could have come from. if undeterministic, i.e., ambiguity exists, error accordingly
	 
	in order to do this, the piece and the coordinate need to be identified. perhaps then , you can match up reachable squares to move. 
	this raises an interesting consideration, take for example , Nf3 , we have the piece, Knight, but which knight? this is ambiguity mentioned above ; there are rule for disambiguating





piece can compute reachable squares ; should computation disregard occupied squares (if so , board is needed as context)? consider takes ; should it be all reachable?

 

at times will need to understand if path is clear on rank or file 

for a given move can validate target versus reachable; if target is not in reachable, illegal move

need to consider boundaries of board when computing reachable 

piece needs reference to board ? for computing reachable; should piece do itself ? or game ? 

move is different than put; move has to clear the previous square; put is not doing that

play a game with pgn as input



piece knows it's current square ; we have no mapping between algebraic notation and piece on board
